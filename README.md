## Installation
If you want the exutable file and start using it, you can find it [here](https://github.com/AbdulazizAlhuzami/One-Piece-TCG-Organizer/releases)

This application requires Python and several libraries: PyQt6 for the GUI, pandas for data handling, matplotlib for plotting, and openpyxl for Excel file support.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdulazizAlhuzami/One-Piece-TCG-Organizer
    cd one-piece-card-tracker
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *Activate the virtual environment:*
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Initial Setup:**
    * If no `one_piece_cards.xlsx` file is found, the application will prompt you to choose a location to save your new collection file.

3.  **Card Operations:**
    * Navigate to the "Card Collection" tab.
    * **Add:** Fill in the card details in the form on the left and click "Add Card to Collection".
    * **Edit:** Select a single row in the table and click "Edit Selected Card", or simply double-click the row. The form will populate for editing. Click "Update Card" to save changes.
    * **Delete:** Select one or more rows in the table and click "Delete Selected Card(s)". Confirm your action when prompted.

4.  **Searching & Filtering:**
    * Use the "Search" bar above the table to filter cards by any text field (Card Number, Name, Crew, etc.). The search is case-insensitive.
    * The "Collection Statistics" tab also provides filters to refine the data displayed in the charts.

5.  **Saving & Loading:**
    * The application automatically saves your data after adding, updating, or deleting cards.
    * You can manually save your collection using the "Manual Save" button or by pressing `Ctrl+S`.
    * To reload your collection from the file (discarding any unsaved changes), go to `File > Reload Collection` or press `Ctrl+R`.

6.  **Exporting Data:**
    * Use `File > Export as CSV...` to save your current collection (including any active filters) to a Comma Separated Values file.
    * Use `File > Export as JSON...` to save your current collection to a JavaScript Object Notation file.
